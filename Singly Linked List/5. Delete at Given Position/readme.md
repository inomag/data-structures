## DELETE A NODE AT A GIVEN POSITION IN A SINGLY LINKED LIST
___

- If the node to be deleted is the root, simply delete it. To delete a middle node, we must have a pointer to the node previous to the node to be deleted. So if positions are not zero, we run a loop position-1 times and get a pointer to the previous node.
