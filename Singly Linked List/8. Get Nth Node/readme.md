## GET Nth NODE IN A SINGLY LINKED LIST
___

- Algorithm
    1. Initialize count = 0
    2. Loop through the link list
        1. if count is equal to the passed index then return current node
        2. Increment count
        3. change current to point to next of the current.

- Time Complexity is O(n).
