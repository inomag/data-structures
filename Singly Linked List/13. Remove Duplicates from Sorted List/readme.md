## REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM A SORTED SINGLY LINKED LIST
___

- Algorithm
    - Traverse the list from the head (or start) node. While traversing, compare each node with its next node. If data of next node is same as current node then delete the next node. Before we delete a node, we need to store next pointer of the node 

- Time Complexity is O(n).
